Also, we need to fix the, uh, downgrade to Pro, 
'cause when users downgrade to Pro and click it, and it 
successfully upgraded them to the Pro plan features, but 
when they downgrade it, it instantly does it. And this is 
causing some issues with everything else too, because... 
we cannot allow that. If users cancel their payments, 
then it will automatically update the dashboard, the users dashboard, 
and they will be downgraded, but it wouldn't be immediately downgraded. I
t would be, like, until the cancellation of the next billing plan. 
So, it would cancel it not now, immediately, but after, as soon as 
it over of the period of time. Because users just, it's just creating 
and messing up the code when users downgrade instantly and on Stripe's 
payment system, they still got it. And they haven't canceled their payments 
at all, so it's not linking it between that. Like, the up, downgrade to Pro
 must have, like, canceled it. So remove downgrade to Pro. Make it say,
  Manage to Pro. And inside of the extension, in the extension popup, 
  and when it has that upgrade to Pro, can you make that to have the 
  building plan portal? Here is the URL for it. And everything must 
  be organized, because this is causing some issues with Supabase and S
  tripes and the dashboard.
